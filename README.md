# AN IOT VEHICLE-THEFT-ALERT
#Overview

The Vehicle-Theft-Alert IoT system is designed to enhance vehicle security by providing real-time alerts in case of unauthorized access or potential theft. This project leverages Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to monitor the vehicle's status and notify the owner immediately through various communication channels. The system is easy to deploy and scalable, making it suitable for a wide range of vehicles.

#Features

Real-Time Monitoring: Continuously monitors the vehicle's status using sensors to detect any unauthorized access or movement.
Instant Alerts: Sends immediate notifications via SMS, email, or mobile app when a potential theft is detected.
GPS Tracking: Provides real-time location tracking of the vehicle, enabling quick recovery in case of theft.
Alarm System: Activates an audible alarm to deter thieves and alert nearby individuals.
Low Power Consumption: Designed to operate efficiently, ensuring minimal power usage and extended battery life.
Cloud Integration: Stores alert data and vehicle location history in the cloud for easy access and analysis.

#Technologies Used

Hardware: Arduino, GPS Module, GSM Module, Motion Sensors, Relay Module.
Software: C++, Arduino IDE, Node-RED.
Cloud Services: AWS IoT, Google Firebase.
Communication Protocols: MQTT, HTTP/HTTPS, SMS.

#How It Works

Sensor Detection: The system uses motion sensors to detect any unusual movement or forced entry into the vehicle.
Data Processing: The microcontroller processes the sensor data and determines whether the movement is unauthorized.
Alert Mechanism: Upon detecting a potential threat, the system sends an alert to the vehicle owner via SMS, email, or through the mobile app.
GPS Tracking: The system activates the GPS module to track the vehicle's location in real-time and shares this information with the owner.
Alarm Activation: If configured, the system triggers an audible alarm to alert nearby individuals and deter the theft.

#Installation and Setup

Hardware Setup: Connect the motion sensors, GPS module, and GSM module to the Arduino/Raspberry Pi as per the provided circuit diagram.
Software Installation: Install the required libraries and dependencies in the Arduino IDE or Python environment.
Cloud Configuration: Set up cloud services (AWS IoT or Firebase) to enable data storage and alert notifications.
Testing: Run the system in a controlled environment to ensure all components are functioning correctly and alerts are being sent.

#Use Cases

Personal Vehicles: Enhance the security of your car, bike, or any personal vehicle.
Fleet Management: Monitor and secure a fleet of vehicles in real-time.
Rental Services: Provide an added layer of security for rental cars or bikes.
